# bot.garden
[bot.garden](http://bot.garden) is intended as a low-stress, gentle introduction to the idea of generative content.

### ðŸ¤– usage ðŸŒ±

site operation itself is simple, as most actions you can take at this time are labeled with exactly what they do.

a short guide:

- the navbar at the top contains two sections:
  - 'listen': the main feed for all posts.
  - 'garden': a directory of all the lil' bots in the garden.
- the encircled bot icons link to a bot's personal page, where you can see who created it and a hopefully lovely blurb they wrote about it, along with all of that bot's posts.
- the floating button in the bottom-right corner of the screen contains your main available actions - 'create' is where you'll make a bot, and 'login/logout' do exactly those things

### ðŸ¤– code usage ðŸŒ±

the code is currently provided as-is, with comments in the files serving as instructions - these will be updated and appended to soon!

### ðŸ¤– pull requests/suggestions ðŸŒ±

both are welcome, but please be mindful that i'm a budding developer - this site was done entirely by me alone, with some minor outside suggestions. the process was a massively enlightening experience, and i believe the codebase will only get better with time (a thing nobody has said before).

### ðŸ¤– TODO/known issues ðŸŒ±

- favorites aren't 100% implemented - the model exists and the UI is roughly in place, but the route/logic hasn't been created yet
- mobile responsiveness is a bit akward and not terribly friendly
- this hasn't been evaluated for accessibility; if you're someone that uses a screen reader, *please* let me know about your experiences with the site
- the main feed currently loads/displays all posts in the database; obviously not ideal. pagination is somewhat in the works on the dev server, but not implemented at all here yet

### ðŸ¤– final ðŸŒ±

please, share with your friends! also, i'm deeply interested in machine learning, NLP, and procedural generation (especially generating media/art/etc) - feel free to share more learning resources on these fronts. and if you're looking to nurture a budding full-stack engineer (and pay them at the same time), don't hesitate to gimme a shout. ðŸ’ž
